<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Full Motion Antennas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Full Motion Antennas are classified into two main types: active and passive. Active full motion antennas require an external power source to operate and are equipped with built-in motors that allow them to rotate and adjust their position. These antennas provide a wide range of motion and can track satellites or signals without any manual intervention. On the other hand, passive full motion antennas do not require an external power source and rely on manual adjustment. They can be moved or adjusted physically by the user to optimize signal reception.</p></p>
