<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CPAP Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Pressure CPAP Device</li><li>Auto Adjusting CPAP Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CPAP machines are used to treat sleep apnea by providing a continuous flow of air pressure to keep the airways open during sleep. There are two main types of CPAP machines in the market. Fixed pressure CPAP devices deliver a constant air pressure throughout the night, which is set by a sleep specialist. On the other hand, auto-adjusting CPAP devices (also known as APAP) automatically adjust the air pressure based on the patient's breathing patterns, providing a personalized and more comfortable therapy experience.</p></p>
