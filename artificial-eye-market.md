<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Eye Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Integrated Implants</li><li>Integrated Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-integrated implants and integrated implants are two types of artificial eye markets. Non-integrated implants are used as a temporary solution for eye loss, in which the prosthetic eye is attached to the eyelids. Integrated implants, on the other hand, involve a more permanent solution where an artificial eye is connected to the eye socket and the patient's eye muscles. These integrated implants allow for more natural eye movement and provide a better aesthetic appearance. Both types cater to individuals who have undergone eye loss due to various reasons.</p></p>
