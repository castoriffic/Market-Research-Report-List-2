<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transformer Leads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Insulated Lead Cable</li><li>Bare Lead Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transformer leads refer to cables that are used to connect the transformer to the electrical system. There are two main types of transformer leads: Insulated Lead Cable and Bare Lead Cable. Insulated Lead Cable has a protective covering made of non-conductive materials, providing insulation and safeguarding against electrical hazards. On the other hand, Bare Lead Cable lacks insulation and is mainly used in applications that require high conductivity. Both market types serve the purpose of facilitating the efficient and safe transmission of electrical energy between the transformer and the electrical system.</p></p>
