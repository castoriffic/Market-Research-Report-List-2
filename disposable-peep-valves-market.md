<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Peep Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adjustable</li><li>Non-adjustable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The market for disposable peep valves can be classified into two types: adjustable and non-adjustable. Adjustable peep valves allow for the adjustment of the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level, which is the pressure in the lungs at the end of exhalation. This feature allows healthcare professionals to customize the PEEP level based on patient needs. On the other hand, non-adjustable peep valves have a fixed PEEP level and cannot be changed. Both types serve the purpose of maintaining proper lung function and oxygenation in patients requiring ventilation support.</p></p>
