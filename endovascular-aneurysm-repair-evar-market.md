<p><strong>Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>The Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) market is highly competitive, with several key players vying for market share. Some of the major players in the market include Medtronic (Endurant), TriVascular (Ovation Xi), and Lombard Medical (Aorfix).</p><p>Medtronic is a leading player in the EVAR market, offering the Endurant stent graft system. The company has a strong market presence and has been experiencing steady growth. In 2019, Medtronic reported global sales of $30.6 billion, with its cardiovascular business, which includes EVAR products, contributing a significant portion to its revenue. The company continues to invest in research and development to further enhance its EVAR offerings and maintain its competitive edge.</p><p>TriVascular, now a subsidiary of Endologix, is known for its Ovation Xi stent graft system. The company has also shown steady growth in the EVAR market. TriVascular received FDA approval for its Ovation Xi system in 2014, and since then, it has gained market share. However, due to the acquisition by Endologix in 2018, specific sales revenue data for TriVascular is not readily available. Nonetheless, the merger is aimed at creating a stronger player in the EVAR market and is expected to drive future growth.</p><p>Lombard Medical offers the Aorfix stent graft system, designed specifically for the treatment of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. The company has a smaller market presence compared to Medtronic and TriVascular but has been steadily growing. However, in 2018, Lombard Medical faced financial difficulties and entered administration. It was subsequently acquired by MicroPort Scientific Corporation in 2018. The acquisition is expected to provide the necessary support for future growth and market expansion.</p><p>The global EVAR market is projected to witness significant growth in the coming years. Factors such as the increasing prevalence of aneurysms, advancements in EVAR technology, and the growing geriatric population contribute to this growth. According to a report by Market Research Future, the EVAR market is expected to reach a market size of $4.1 billion by 2023, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.80% during the forecast period.</p><p>In summary, Medtronic, with its Endurant stent graft system, holds a dominant position in the EVAR market, followed by TriVascular with its Ovation Xi system. Lombard Medical, now owned by MicroPort Scientific Corporation, is also making strides in the market. The EVAR market is expected to experience substantial growth in the future, driven by factors such as increasing prevalence of aneurysms and technological advancements.</p></p>
