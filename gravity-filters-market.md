<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gravity Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Gravity Separators</li><li>Horizontal Gravity Separators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Gravity filters are a type of filtration system that utilize the force of gravity to separate solids from liquids. Vertical gravity separators are vertical tanks that allow liquids and suspended solids to separate by gravity, with the solids settling at the bottom and the clarified water rising to the top. On the other hand, horizontal gravity separators are horizontal vessels that separate immiscible liquids of different densities, such as oil and water, by allowing gravity to cause their separation. Both types of gravity filters are used in various industries for efficient solid-liquid separation processes.</p></p>
