<p><strong>The Gold Mining Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Placer Mining</li><li>Sluicing</li><li>Gold Panning</li><li>Dredging</li><li>Hard-Rock Mining</li><li>Rocker Box</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gold mining involves the extraction of gold from the earthâ€™s surface or underneath it. Placer mining is the process of mining gold from alluvial deposits, usually through panning or sluicing. Gold panning refers to the manual technique of using a pan to separate gold from other sediments. Sluicing employs water to wash away gravel and capture gold using a channel with riffles. Dredging involves the use of a floating machine to suck up sediment and extract gold. Hard-rock mining involves extracting gold from quartz veins underground. The rocker box is a manually operated device used for separating gold from other materials.</p></p>
