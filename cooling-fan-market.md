<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cooling Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cooling fan market is categorized into three main types: axial fans, centrifugal fans, and others. Axial fans are designed with a propeller-shaped blade that creates airflow parallel to the axis. They are commonly used in applications requiring a large volume of air movement. Centrifugal fans, on the other hand, utilize a high-speed impeller that directs air radially outwards from the center. This type is suitable for applications that require increased pressure and airflow. The "Others" category includes various types of cooling fans such as mixed-flow fans, cross-flow fans, and tangential fans.</p></p>
