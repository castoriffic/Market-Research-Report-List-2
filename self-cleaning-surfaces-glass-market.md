<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-cleaning Surfaces Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic</li><li>Hydrophobic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-cleaning surfaces glass market is categorized into two types: hydrophilic and hydrophobic. Hydrophilic glass surfaces have a special coating that allows water to spread evenly and form a thin film, enabling dirt and debris to be easily washed away by rain or other water sources. Hydrophobic glass surfaces, on the other hand, repel water droplets due to their unique coating, preventing dirt and water staining from adhering to the surface. Both types provide the benefit of self-cleaning properties, reducing the time and effort required for maintenance and ensuring a clearer and cleaner glass surface.</p></p>
