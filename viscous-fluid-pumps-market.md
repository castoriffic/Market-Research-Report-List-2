<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Viscous Fluid Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Type</li><li>Horizontal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Viscous fluid pumps are categorized into two main types: vertical type and horizontal type. Vertical type pumps are designed with a vertical configuration, where the pump shaft is placed vertically. These pumps are mainly suited for applications where space is limited. On the other hand, horizontal type pumps are designed with a horizontal configuration, where the pump shaft is placed horizontally. These pumps are commonly used in applications where a high flow rate is required and space is not a constraint. Both types serve the purpose of pumping viscous fluids efficiently.</p></p>
