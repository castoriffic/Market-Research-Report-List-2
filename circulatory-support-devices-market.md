<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Circulatory Support Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventricular Assisted Device (VAD)</li><li>Total Artificial Heart (TAH)</li><li>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Circulatory support devices come in different types, including Ventricular Assisted Devices (VADs), Total Artificial Hearts (TAHs), and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). VADs are mechanical pumps that help the weakened heart by aiding in blood circulation. TAHs completely replace the failing heart and are usually used as a temporary solution while a patient awaits a heart transplant. ECMO is an external machine that provides cardiac and respiratory support, acting as a temporary heart and lung for patients with severe heart or lung failure. These devices provide critical support to patients with compromised circulatory systems.</p></p>
