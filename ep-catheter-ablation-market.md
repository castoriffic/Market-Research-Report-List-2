<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EP Catheter Ablation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radiofrequency Ablation Catheters</li><li>Cryoablation EP Catheters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EP Catheter Ablation market includes two main types of catheters: Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) Catheters and Cryoablation EP Catheters. RFA Catheters use high-frequency electrical current to create heat and destroy abnormal tissue causing arrhythmias. On the other hand, Cryoablation EP Catheters use extreme cold temperatures to freeze and eliminate abnormal heart tissue. Both catheters are used in cardiac ablation procedures to treat conditions like atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, aiming to restore normal heart rhythm and improve patient outcomes.</p></p>
