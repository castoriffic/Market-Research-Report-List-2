<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Belt Sampler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Sweep Sampler</li><li>Conventional Cross Stream Sampler</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Belt samplers are widely used in industries to obtain representative samples of bulk materials on a moving conveyor belt. Rotary sweep sampler is a type of belt sampler that continuously collects material from the conveyor belt as it rotates, allowing for a more precise and uniform sample. Conventional cross stream sampler, on the other hand, extracts material from the flow stream perpendicular to the belt direction, ensuring a representative sample. Other types of belt samplers may include linear sweep samplers and reverse flow samplers, each with its own specific application and advantages.</p></p>
