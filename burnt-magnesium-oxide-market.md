<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Burnt Magnesium Oxide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lightly Burnt Powder</li><li>Reburned Powder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Burnt Magnesium Oxide is available in two market types: Lightly Burnt Powder and Reburned Powder. Lightly Burnt Powder is produced by burning magnesium carbonate at a lower temperature, resulting in a powder with smaller particle size and higher reactivity. It is commonly used in industries like refractories and chemicals. Reburned Powder, on the other hand, is produced by exposing lightly burnt powder to additional heat treatment, resulting in improved chemical composition and higher melting point. This type is mainly used in fields like ceramics and metallurgy.</p></p>
