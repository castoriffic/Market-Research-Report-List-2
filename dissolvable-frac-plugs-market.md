<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dissolvable Frac Plugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Small Caliber</li><li>Large Caliber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dissolvable frac plugs market is categorized into two types based on the plug's caliber size - small and large. Small caliber plugs are designed for applications that require a lower pressure rating, such as wellbore isolation during fracturing. These plugs are smaller in size and have the ability to dissolve quickly after completing their intended purpose. On the other hand, large caliber plugs are used in high-pressure environments and have a higher pressure rating. These plugs dissolve at a slower rate due to their larger size and are suitable for more demanding fracturing operations.</p></p>
