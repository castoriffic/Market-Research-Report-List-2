<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Edge Finder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Type</li><li>Photoelectric Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Edge Finder is a device used in machining to locate the edges of a workpiece accurately. Mechanical type edge finders have a spring-loaded cylindrical body that moves when it contacts the workpiece edge, indicating its position. This type requires physical contact and is suitable for rough applications. On the other hand, photoelectric type edge finders utilize a light beam to detect the edge without physical contact. They offer higher precision and are better suited for delicate workpieces. Both market types serve the same purpose of locating edges but differ in their method of operation and suitability for different applications.</p></p>
