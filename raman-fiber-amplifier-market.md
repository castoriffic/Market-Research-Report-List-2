<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Raman Fiber Amplifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lumped</li><li>Distributed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Raman Fiber Amplifier market is segmented into two types: lumped and distributed amplifiers. Lumped amplifiers use discrete optical amplification units placed at specific points along the fiber, resulting in discrete amplification. On the other hand, distributed amplifiers provide amplification continuously along the entire length of the fiber, resulting in uniform amplification. Lumped amplifiers are commonly used in short-haul applications, while distributed amplifiers are preferred for long-haul applications due to their ability to overcome signal losses effectively.</p></p>
