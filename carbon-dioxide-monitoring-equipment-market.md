<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Dioxide Monitoring Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mainstream</li><li>Sidestream</li><li>Microstream</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon dioxide monitoring equipment is used to measure the levels of carbon dioxide in the body. Mainstream monitoring involves directly sampling the exhaled CO2 from the patient's airway. Sidestream monitoring involves removing a small portion of the patient's exhaled breath from the airway through a thin tube. Microstream monitoring, on the other hand, uses a small sensor placed directly in the patient's airway to measure CO2 levels. These different types of monitoring methods offer flexibility and accuracy in measuring carbon dioxide levels in various medical settings.</p></p>
