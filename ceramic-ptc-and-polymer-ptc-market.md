<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ceramic PTC and Polymer PTC Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PPTC</li><li>CPTC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ceramic PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) and Polymer PTC are both types of PTC thermistors used for electrical protection. Ceramic PTC devices are made of ceramic materials and exhibit a sharp increase in resistance as temperature rises, providing overcurrent protection. Polymer PTC devices are composed of conductive polymers and possess a similar response, but with a more gradual increase in resistance. PPTC (Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient) devices are self-resetting, providing automatic protection, while CPTC (Ceramic Positive Temperature Coefficient) devices require manual resetting after a fault condition.</p></p>
