<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Corrosion-resistant Magnetic Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Shaft</li><li>Rotating Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The corrosion-resistant magnetic pump market can be categorized into two types based on the shaft design: stationary shaft and rotating shaft. In a stationary shaft magnetic pump, the impeller is attached to a stationary shaft while the outer magnetic ring rotates, creating a magnetic field that transfers the torque to the impeller. On the other hand, in a rotating shaft magnetic pump, the impeller and the outer magnetic ring both rotate together, eliminating the need for a stationary shaft. These different designs cater to various application requirements and offer reliable and efficient solutions for handling corrosive fluids.</p></p>
