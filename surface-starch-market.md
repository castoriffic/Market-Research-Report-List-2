<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Starch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder</li><li>Liquid</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The surface starch market consists of two main types: powdered and liquid starch. Powdered starch is a dry, granular form that is commonly used for cooking, baking, and as a thickening agent. It is versatile and can be easily measured and stored. On the other hand, liquid starch is a more concentrated and pre-mixed form that is used for laundry purposes, such as stiffening fabrics and reducing wrinkling. It is typically applied directly onto the fabric or added to the washing machine during the rinse cycle. Both types have their own specific uses and benefits.</p></p>
