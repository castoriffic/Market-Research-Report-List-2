<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coffee Degassing Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Circle</li><li>Square</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The coffee degassing valves market consists of two main types: circle and square valves. Circle valves are small round-shaped valves that release gas while keeping oxygen from entering the coffee bag. These valves are commonly used in coffee packaging to maintain freshness and prevent spoilage. On the other hand, square valves are larger, square-shaped valves that serve the same purpose. Both circle and square valves are designed to prolong the shelf life of coffee by allowing the release of carbon dioxide gas generated during the roasting process, while blocking the entry of harmful oxygen.</p></p>
