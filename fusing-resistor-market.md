<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fusing Resistor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resettable Fuse Resistor</li><li>One-time Fuse Resistor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The fusing resistor market comprises two main types: Resettable Fuse Resistor and One-time Fuse Resistor. Resettable Fuse Resistors are designed to protect electronic circuits by automatically disconnecting the power supply in case of overcurrent or short circuit, and can be reset after the fault is removed. On the other hand, One-time Fuse Resistors are non-resettable, meaning that once they have experienced an overcurrent or short circuit, they permanently disconnect the circuit. Both types play a crucial role in safeguarding electronic devices and preventing damage from electrical faults.</p></p>
