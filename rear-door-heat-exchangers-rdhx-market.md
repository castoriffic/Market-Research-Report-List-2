<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rear Door Heat Exchangers (RDHx) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rear Door Heat Exchangers (RDHx) are devices used in data centers to improve the cooling efficiency and reduce energy consumption. Active Type RDHx are equipped with fans to actively expel the heat out of the data center. They require power to operate and provide better cooling capacity. On the other hand, Passive Type RDHx do not have fans but instead rely on natural convection to dissipate heat. They are less effective compared to active types but are more energy-efficient as they do not require additional power.</p></p>
