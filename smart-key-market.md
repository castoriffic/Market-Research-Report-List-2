<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Key Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capacitive Sensor Technology</li><li>Infra-Red Sensor Technology</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Smart Key Market Types:</p><p>1. Capacitive Sensor Technology: Smart keys that utilize capacitive sensor technology use the electrical properties of the human body to detect touch and proximity. These keys are equipped with touch-sensitive surfaces that respond to the conductive properties of the user's skin. Through capacitance changes, the key detects human touch and enables keyless access or control functions.</p><p>2. Infra-Red Sensor Technology: Smart keys incorporating infra-red sensor technology use infrared light to detect the presence of objects or individuals. These keys emit infrared light, and when the light reflects off an object or person, it is detected by the key's sensor. This enables keyless access or control functions by sensing the proximity of the user or objects.</p></p>
