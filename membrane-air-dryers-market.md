<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Air Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porous</li><li>Non-Porous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Membrane air dryers are devices used to remove water vapor from compressed air systems. There are two main types of membrane air dryers - porous and non-porous.</p><p>Porous membrane air dryers use a porous membrane material that allows water vapor to pass through while blocking other gases. As compressed air flows through the membrane, the moisture is separated, resulting in dried air.</p><p>Non-porous membrane air dryers, on the other hand, use non-porous membrane materials that are impermeable to water vapor. These dryers rely on a pressure difference across the membrane to force water vapor through it, achieving dry air.</p><p>Both types of membrane air dryers are effective in removing moisture from compressed air systems, with their selection depending on the specific needs and requirements of the application.</p></p>
