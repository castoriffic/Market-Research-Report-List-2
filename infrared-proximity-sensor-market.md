<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Proximity Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the context of the Infrared Proximity Sensor market, there are two main types: Active and Passive sensors. Active sensors emit infrared light and measure the reflection or absence of it to detect the presence or proximity of an object. These sensors are commonly used in applications like motion detection and robotics. On the other hand, passive sensors detect the infrared radiation emitted by objects themselves, where the presence of an object causes a change in the sensor's output. Passive sensors are commonly found in temperature measurement and night vision applications.</p></p>
